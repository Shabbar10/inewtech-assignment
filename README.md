This is an [iNew Tech](https://www.inewtech.in/) assignment.

# Getting Started
Create a .env or .env.local file in the project's root directory with the following information:
```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=MYSQL_USERNAME
DB_PASS=MYSQL_PASSWORD
DB_NAME=inewtech
DB_PORT=3306
```
Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Alternatively, you can run `npm run build` to run the server in production mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
